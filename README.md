About the app:
    It is basic user registration app
    After you run the app and go to localhost:3000 > / page you will get to home page
    There is navigation and register button
    Click the register button and get to form where you can register
    After that you will be redirected to users page where you can see all users registered
    You can update and delete
    I did validation on back end for registration and on front end for update for diversity
    You can not change password or see it fully because it is confidential
    I did not hash the passwords because it was out of topic and no extra mark
